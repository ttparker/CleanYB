This project contains seven Julia files:

Monte Carlo
1. "CustomTypes.jl" only defines data types that are used by other files.  It is not executed.
2. "main.jl" is the main program that executes the Monte Carlo.  It reads the run parameters (couplings, temperature, system size, number Monte Carlo sweeps, etc.) in from a text file named "Input", and saves its results to a file named "Output".  The "Output" files can be quite large (e.g. several gigabytes).
3. "Yb.jl" contains the details of the form of the general Hamiltonian being simulated.  It is not executed.
4. "MC.jl" contains the actual Monte Carlo algorithm.  It is not executed.

Data Analysis
5. "DataAnalysis.jl" reads in one or more raw output files produced by "main.jl" for a specific system, processes the data, and saves the processed data as a JLD file to a subdirectory named "Analyzed/" (which need not already exist).  This file must be run separately for each system (e.g. of a given size).  The data analysis can take several hours for large data files.
6. "MakePlots" reads in the processed data produced for the various systems by "DataAnalysis.jl" and combines it into plots displaying the energy, heat capacity, order parameter, and Binder ratios as a function of temperatures for various systems.
7. "EnergyHistogram" reads in a raw data file produced by "main.jl" and plots the energy distribution at a single temperature for a single system.

Dependencies:
"main.jl" includes "CustomTypes.jl", "Yb.jl", and "MC.jl".
"DataAnalysis.jl" and "MakePlots.jl" include "CustomTypes.jl".
